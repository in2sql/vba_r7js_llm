' Updated on 2024-08-23.
' Basic Edition: This edition of the Send Doc Creator only has the style deleting mechanism and does not have any mechanisms regarding saving the send doc.

' Thanks to Truf for creating and providing the original "Create Send Doc" macro this macro is based on! You can find Truf's macros on his website at https://debate-decoded.ghost.io/leveling-up-verbatim/

	' If DeleteStyles is set to True, the styles listed in the StylesToDelete array will be deleted. If DeleteStyles is set to False, the styles listed in the StylesToDelete array will not be deleted.
	' If you want to disable the deletion of the styles listed in the StylesToDelete array, set DeleteStyles to False.
	DeleteStyles = True
	
	' <<SET THE LINKED CHARACTER STYLES TO DELETE HERE!>>
	' A linked style will either apply the style to the entire paragraph or a selection of words depending on what you have selected. If you have clicked on a paragraph and have selected no text or have selected the entire paragraph, it will apply the paragraph variant of the style. If you have selected a subset of the paragraph, it will apply the character variant of the style to your selection. The options in this section control whether this macro will delete the instances of character variants of linked styles and which linked styles this macro will operate on.

	' This ensures all paragraph marks in lines or paragraphs that have character variants of linked styles set to be delted are in Tag style so they do not get deleted in the style deletion stage of this macro.
	' Otherwise, lines ending in character variants of linked styles set to be delted may have their paragraph mark deleted and have the following line be merged into them, which can mess up the formatting of the line.
