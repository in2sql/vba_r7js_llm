# Border.Color property (Excel)

## Description
This page is from the Excel VBA API reference. The content might be limited due to browser compatibility issues.

## Syntax
```vba
Charts("Chart1").Axes(xlValue).TickLabels.Font.Color = _ 
 RGB(0, 255, 0)
```

## Remarks
Important
Note that the visual properties of a Border object are interlocked; that is, changing one property can induce changes in another. In most cases, the induced changes serve to make the border visible (which may or may not be desirable). However, other (more unexpected) results are possible. For an example, see the Border object.
