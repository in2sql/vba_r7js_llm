# AxisTitle.IncludeInLayout property (Excel)

## Description
This page is from the Excel VBA API reference. The content might be limited due to browser compatibility issues.

## Remarks
This property does not affect whether a chart is in autolayout mode. If the user adds a title by using the Above Chart command, the chart will resize smaller. If the user then removes the title or selects one of the overlay title options, the chart will resize larger, as if the title were not on the chart.

## Example
No VBA example available.
