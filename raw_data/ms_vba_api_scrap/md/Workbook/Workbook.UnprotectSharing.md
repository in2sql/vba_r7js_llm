# Workbook.UnprotectSharing Method (Excel)

## Business Description
The `UnprotectSharing` method in Excel allows you to turn off protection for sharing a workbook. This enables users to make changes that were previously restricted when the workbook was set up for shared use and protected against certain edits.

## Behavior
- **Purpose**: Removes the sharing protection from a workbook so that changes can be made without the previous restrictions.
- **Action**: Once protection is removed, all users can edit the workbook as if it were not shared or protected.
- **Use Case**: Useful when you need to update, restructure, or finalize a workbook that was previously shared among multiple users.

## Example Usage
```vba
' Remove sharing protection from the active workbook
ActiveWorkbook.UnprotectSharing

' Remove sharing protection with a password (if one was set)
ActiveWorkbook.UnprotectSharing Password:="yourpassword"
```

**Tip:** Always ensure that removing sharing protection is appropriate for your workflow, as it allows unrestricted editing by all users.
