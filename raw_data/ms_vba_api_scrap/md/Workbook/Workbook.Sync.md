# Workbook.Sync Property (Excel)

**Status:** Deprecated (remains for backward compatibility; do not use in new applications)

## Business Description

The `Workbook.Sync` property in Excel was designed to manage synchronization features for workbooks, particularly in collaborative or shared environments. Although this property is still present for compatibility with older solutions, it is no longer recommended for use in modern applications or new development projects.

## Behavior

- Allows access to synchronization functionality for a workbook.
- Intended for scenarios where multiple users might need to update or synchronize shared workbook data.
- No longer maintained or enhanced; provided solely for legacy support.

## Parameters

This property does not accept parameters. It is accessed directly from a `Workbook` object.

## Methods

- **Get:** Retrieve the current synchronization object associated with the workbook.
- **Set:** Not applicable (read-only property).

## Example Usage

> Modern applications should avoid using this property. If you encounter it in legacy code, consider refactoring to remove dependencies on deprecated synchronization features.
