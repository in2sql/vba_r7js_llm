## Description
This page is from the Excel VBA API reference. The content might be limited due to browser compatibility issues.

## Remarks
Data labels now track the actual data point to which they are attached (as opposed to the legacy behavior of tracking the index of the data point), allowing the label-to-point relationship to persist across events such as filter and sort.
