# Application.ThisWorkbook property (Excel)

## Description
This page is from the Excel VBA API reference. The content might be limited due to browser compatibility issues.

## Syntax
```vba
ThisWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False
```

## Remarks
Use this property to refer to the workbook that contains your macro code. ThisWorkbook is the only way to refer to an add-in workbook from inside the add-in itself. The ActiveWorkbook property doesn't return the add-in workbook; it returns the workbook that's calling the add-in.

## Example
No VBA example available.
