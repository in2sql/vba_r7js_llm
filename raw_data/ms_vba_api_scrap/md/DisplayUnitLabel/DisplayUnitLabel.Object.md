# DisplayUnitLabel Object

## Business Description
Represents a unit label on the value axis in the specified chart. Unit labels are useful for charting large values—for example, numbers in the millions or billions.

## Behavior
Represents a unit label on the value axis in the specified chart. Unit labels are useful for charting large values—for example, numbers in the millions or billions. You can make the chart more readable by using a single unit label instead of large numbers with strings of zeros next to the tick marks on the axis. This way, you need never have numbers of more than one or two digits by the tick marks.
